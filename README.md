For latest meeting notes, refer to the GitHub. Documentation will be updated on the cluster here on an ongoing basis.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Update 03.04.19: 
Documentation is key. 
Carroll will soon be back in action. 
Nicholas has been working a bit on nulls and averaging.
The big idea: to get a preliminary good-enough ground truth dataset that then can be used with spatial interpolation on the original. This will produce the gold dataset on which to train the final models for prediction.

Update 1/17/2019:
With the start of the new school semester, both Nicholas and Carroll are adjusting to their new schedules. 
Currently we have gone back to data processing and are looking at interpolation using geographically nearby sites for missing data. 

Some ideas: 
we could try to interpolate using a diffisuion and vector field model
or use an extended kallman filter

Update 1/4/2019: 
To-Do:
1. Calculate min and max values for all columns ahead of time to assist with min max scaling
2. add K-means
3. refactor code for better indexing

PLAN:
"so conceptually heres the idea i have in my head for our pipeline
mpi_transform will transform the data to the format we need
then we have a windower/sequencer
which scales to the min/max
and records them
and then we create a feature enrichment script to add additional features?
so 3 seperate stages
"

Update 12/28/18:

Both Carroll and Nicholas have achieved great results in mean absolute error and mean squared error metrics using random forest and a LSTM. FFT was tried with little advantage in using it. The next step will be wavelet-transform. 

Work at scale on the cluster.
